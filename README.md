# Current/Emerging Trends in CS

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project, I was initially given a starter code that provided the game environment, rules and supporting python files. I was responsible for implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm, including the neural network model, training loop, epsilon-greedy action selection, Q-value updates, and parameter tuning. The main objective of the project was to train a pirate NPC to successfully navigate the maze and find the treasure.

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design systems that solve real-world problems and improve everyday life. This work matters because these systems influence decisions in areas such as healthcare, finance and education, where their quality can have a direct impact. A well-designed AI system can improve efficiency and accessibility, while a poorly designed system can cause harm or reinforce existing biases.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by decomposing them into smaller, manageable parts and clearly defining the objectives and constraints. I then select appropriate models or algorithms to address each component. When working with AI, this includes analyzing data quality, choosing the appropriate learning approach, and evaluating performance to ensure the solution aligns with the problem's goals.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities include protecting user privacy, reducing bias, and ensuring transparency in system behavior. At the same time, I am responsible for developing secure, reliable systems that meet organizational standards. By recognizing the limitations of AI and communicating risks clearly, I balance innovation with accountability to ensure technology benefits both end users and the organization.
