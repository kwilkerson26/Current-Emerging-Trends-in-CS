# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design systems that solve real-world problems and improve everyday life. This work matters because these systems influence decisions in areas such as healthcare, finance and education, where their quality can have a direct impact. A well-designed AI system can improve efficiency and accessibility, while a poorly designed system can cause harm or reinforce existing biases.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by decomposing them into smaller, manageable parts and clearly defining the objectives and constraints. I then select appropriate models or algorithms to address each component. When working with AI, this includes analyzing data quality, choosing the appropriate learning approach, and evaluating performance to ensure the solution aligns with the problem's goals.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities include protecting user privacy, reducing bias, and ensuring transparency in system behavior. At the same time, I am responsible for developing secure, reliable systems that meet organizational standards. By recognizing the limitations of AI and communicating risks clearly, I balance innovation with accountability to ensure technology benefits both end users and the organization.
